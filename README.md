# Skyhook Clustering Analysis
## Introduction
This repository contains the code to perform K-means clustering and other exploratory analyses on
 aggregated internet endpoint data from [Skyhook](https://www.skyhook.com/). Skyhook's proprietary software provides the ability 
 to locate connected devices and requests in any environment across the globe. The data used for this 
 analysis summarizes the number of devices and requests within each 100m x 100m tile across 3 
 provinces of Indonesia from Dec 2019 to Jan 2020. This data was analyzed to find trends and anomalies
  in the behavior of people connecting to the internet in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. 
  The data from Skyhook for Jakarta and other provinces can be used to analyze the impact of the 
  devastating New Year's eve floods that hit Jakarta in Jan 2020.

ArcGIS was also used in this analysis to create the plots and integrate the elevation data from MERIT.
